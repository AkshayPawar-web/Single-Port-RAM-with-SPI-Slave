## Overview 

This repository contains the Verilog HDL code and implementation details for a system that interfaces a RAM (Random Peripheral Memory) module with an external master device via an
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Slave module. The core functionality is to allow the SPI Master to read from and write to the on-chip RAM.
